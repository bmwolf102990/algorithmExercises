    "So, I am going to need to handle reversing both positive and negative ints. Reversing the positive ints will be easy; just convert to a string, split to an array, reverse, join back to a string and convert back to a number. I can do all the same procedures with a negative ints, but I will need to remove the negative sign before I do anything else and then I will have to add it back onto the front of the array before joining and converting back to a number. The final piece of the puzzle is the check that `x` is within the 32-bit int range. I don't know what the exact numbers are, but I don't have to. I can use `2**31` which evaluates to the number I need. \n",

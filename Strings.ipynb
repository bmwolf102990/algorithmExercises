    "So my first thought was that the prompt is rather vague about what actually constitutes a \"letter range\". From looking at test cases I deduced that a valid letter range has to be a string of alphabetically sequential characters (i.e \"abcd\", \"wxyz\" etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to determine what letter is missing (if any) from the provided range, we need to have something to compare against; and since the range has to be sequentially related to the actual alphabet, creating a comparative string of the entire alphabet makes sense to me. After that, all I need to do is figure out how to take any possible snippet of the alphabet, find that same snippet within my comparative alphabet string, and see if they match. The comparison process will be iterative so I will need to employ a loop of some kind.\n",
